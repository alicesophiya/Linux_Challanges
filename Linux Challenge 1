Linux Challenge 1
The database server called centos-host is running short on space! You have been asked to add an LVM volume for the Database team using some of the existing disks on this server.

All the tasks require you to be root, so the first step is to become root

sudo -i
Individual Steps
Linux Server
Install the correct packages that will allow the use of "lvm" on the centos machine.

First we need to discover what the correct package is that needs to be installed. A google search will lead you to lvm2

Install package
yum install -y lvm2
dba_users
Create a group called "dba_users" and add the user called 'bob' to this group
groupadd dba_users
Add bob to group
usermod -G dba_users bob
/dev/vdb
Create a Physical Volume for "/dev/vdb"
pvcreate /dev/vdb
/dev/vdc
Create a Physical Volume for "/dev/vdc"
pvcreate /dev/vdc
volume-group
Create a volume group called "dba_storage" using the physical volumes "/dev/vdb" and "/dev/vdc"
vgcreate dba_storage /dev/vdb /dev/vdc
lvm
Create an "lvm" called "volume_1" from the volume group called "dba_storage". Make use of the entire space available in the volume group.
lvcreate -n volume_1 -l 100%FREE dba_storage
persistent-mountpoint
Format the lvm volume "volume_1" as an "XFS" filesystem
mkfs.xfs /dev/dba_storage/volume_1
Mount the filesystem at the path "/mnt/dba_storage".
mkdir -p /mnt/dba_storage
mount -t xfs /dev/dba_storage/volume_1 /mnt/dba_storage
Make sure that this mount point is persistent across reboots with the correct default options.
vi /etc/fstab
Add the following line to the end of the file and save.

/dev/mapper/dba_storage-volume_1 /mnt/dba_storage xfs defaults 0 0
group-permission
Ensure that the mountpoint "/mnt/dba_storage" has the group ownership set to the "dba_users" group
chown :dba_users /mnt/dba_storage
Ensure that the mount point "/mnt/dba_storage" has "read/write" and execute permissions for the owner and group and no permissions for anyone else.
chmod 770 /mnt/dba_storage
Automate the entire lab in a single script!
Pretty much everything done above, in the same order. We automate the vi step by using the append redirection to /etc/fstab

Single Script Automation
First, become root

sudo -i
Then

{
# Paste this entire script to the command prompt.
# When it completes, press the check button.

## Install lvm

yum install -y lvm2

## dba_users

# Create group
groupadd dba_users
# Add bob
usermod -G dba_users bob

## Create PVs

pvcreate /dev/vdb
pvcreate /dev/vdc

## Create VG

vgcreate dba_storage /dev/vdb /dev/vdc

## Create LVM

lvcreate -n volume_1 -l 100%FREE dba_storage

## Persistent mountpoint

# Format
mkfs.xfs /dev/dba_storage/volume_1
# Mount
mkdir -p /mnt/dba_storage
mount -t xfs /dev/dba_storage/volume_1 /mnt/dba_storage
# Make persistent
echo "/dev/mapper/dba_storage-volume_1 /mnt/dba_storage xfs defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
# Ensure that the mountpoint "/mnt/dba_storage" has the group ownership set to the "dba_users" group
chown :dba_users /mnt/dba_storage
# Ensure that the mount point "/mnt/dba_storage" has "read/write" and execute permissions for the owner and group and no permissions for anyone else.
chmod 770 /mnt/dba_storage
}
